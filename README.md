# Titanic-Machine-Learning-model
A classification problem related to predicting a passenger's survival in the Titanic sinking disaster. Started the problem by 
viewing, analysing and visualizing the relation and estimated effects of different features with the dependent variable i.e. 
'Survival'. Visualised each variable by means of various graphs like histograms, bar graphs, point plots using matplotlib and 
seaborn libraries(Univariate analysis). Completed the train and test dataset by filling the features having missing values with
median for numeric datatype and mode for categorical datatype. Performed feature engineering to exclude features having negligible
importance in the prediction and created new features using the combination of two or more features.Then I categorized various features like Name, Age and Fare into different bands using pandasâ€™ qcut () function. Developed and compared different models 
based on their accuracy scores using different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression,Decision tree, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forests. Parameter tuning was also done for all these models. An accuracy score of 78.5% was finally obtained using Random Forest based model.
